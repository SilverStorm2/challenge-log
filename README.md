## Daily Log üìÖ

| Day  | Date       | Summary of Work Done                                                                                 | Links/Notes |
|------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Day 11| 2024-10-05| Today, I focused on JavaScript classes and learned how they act as blueprints for creating objects. Using class, I defined properties and methods for objects. The constructor method initializes new objects, and the this keyword allows each instance to manage its own data. I practiced creating multiple instances and modifying their properties without affecting others. This showed me how to use classes for code organization and flexibility, making it easier to manage complex data structures in applications.|            |
| Day 10| 2024-10-04| I learned how to dynamically render content using Handlebars, implemented Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, set up npm for task automation, integrated Sass for styling, resolved ESLint configuration issues, and managed Git version control, which provided insights into organizing and debugging real-world web applications efficiently.             |
| Day 9| 2024-10-03| Continuing my learning, I focused on object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in JavaScript. I started by exploring the idea of objects and classes, understanding how they help organize code and create reusable components. I learned how to use constructors to create multiple instances of objects with shared properties and methods. Next, I studied inheritance, which allows one class to extend another, passing down properties and behaviors to child classes. I also explored the super keyword to access and modify parent class properties. Additionally, I practiced using encapsulation, using private and public methods to control how data is accessed and modified. This helps create more secure and maintainable code. Finally, I reviewed the concept of polymorphism, which allows methods in different classes to have the same name but behave differently based on the class context. Overall, these OOP concepts will be crucial for building more structured and scalable applications in my new project.|https://poradnik-js.kodilla.com/oop-classes|
| Day 8| 2024-10-02 | I‚Äôm starting a new project and have learned some key concepts. First, I understood the difference between simple and complex data types and how they are handled in code. I also explored how functions work when using different data types and the impact this has on the original values. I learned about the this keyword, which changes its behavior depending on the context. Additionally, I discovered methods to control the this context in different situations. Overall, I gained a better understanding of how JavaScript manages data and memory to make programs more efficient.|             |
| Day 7| 2024-10-01 | Project Summary: JavaScript Blog - Throughout this project, I worked on building a dynamic blog using JavaScript and Handlebars.js. I successfully integrated Handlebars templates to generate HTML elements dynamically and learned how to manage user interactions such as filtering articles by tags and authors. Additionally, I tackled challenges with Git version management, using commands like rebase and merge to handle conflicts. I also improved code quality by configuring ESLint and addressing indentation and syntax errors. This experience enhanced my understanding of modular JavaScript structure, templating, and documentation using Markdown.|             |
| Day 6| 2024-09-30 | Today, I learned several important lessons about working with Git, resolving conflicts, and project management. First, I reverted to an earlier stable version because the current state was too problematic. After modifying the code and attempting to push it to GitHub, I encountered issues due to conflicts between my local changes and the remote repository. I learned how to use strategies like git pull --rebase and manually resolving merge conflicts to ensure a smooth integration. This experience emphasized the importance of maintaining version history and understanding Git commands thoroughly.|             |
| Day 5| 2024-09-29 | Today, I focused on configuring `Prettier` and `ESLint` to maintain consistent code styling and improve readability. I explored how specific settings in Prettier, such as using single quotes, enforcing semicolons, and trailing commas, impact code formatting. Additionally, I learned to customize ESLint rules to support modern JavaScript (ES6) while allowing for browser-specific globals. I also experimented with disabling and modifying ESLint rules like no-console and quotes, to adapt them to my coding needs. This process helped me understand how these tools work together to create a streamlined development experience.|             |
| Day 4| 2024-09-28 | Today I focused on enhancing my skills in both HTML and JavaScript. I worked extensively on refactoring the structure of HTML to improve readability and maintainability, specifically updating the data attributes and reorganizing the hierarchy of elements in the sidebar. In JavaScript, I deepened my understanding of DOM manipulation and event handling by refining functions such as generateTitleLinks, generateTags, and generateAuthors. I also tackled logical errors in event handlers and fixed variable scope issues. This session helped solidify my knowledge of code modularization and debugging.|             |                                                                                                     
| Day 3| 2024-09-27 | Today, I enhanced my JavaScript skills by refactoring the generateTags function and learning how to work efficiently with objects and arrays. I implemented a new calculateTagsParams function to dynamically analyze tag frequency and adjust styles accordingly. Additionally, I improved event listeners for both tags and authors, ensuring a smooth user experience when filtering articles.|             |
| Day 2| 2024-09-26 | Today, I refactored the `generateTags` function to eliminate duplicate code and improve efficiency. I also fixed event listener bindings for both tags and authors, ensuring proper interaction when filtering articles. The `titleClickHandler` function was enhanced for better link activation and article display management. I successfully tested the dynamic tag and author filtering system. |             |
| Day 1| 2024-09-25 | Today, I set the foundation for my #100DaysOfCode challenge by working on JavaScript basics and setting up my development environment. I configured essential tools like Git for version control and ESLint for code quality. I also began working on a dynamic blog project where tags and authors are generated from data-attributes, ensuring cleaner HTML. Additionally, I learned how to manage dependencies using NPM and practiced integrating Prettier for code formatting. | [Link to code/project] |
