|------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Day 38| 2024-11-01|Today, I learned how to use the `addEventListener()` method in JavaScript to add `events` to HTML elements. This method attaches an event handler to a specific element without overwriting existing events, allowing multiple events on the same element. I explored adding event handlers like `"click"` or `"mouseover"` and saw how it works on various elements, including the window object. I also learned about event propagation (bubbling and capturing) and how to use the `removeEventListener()` method to remove event handlers when needed.||
| Day 37| 2024-10-31|Today, I explored how JavaScript interacts with HTML elements through `events`. I learned that events can trigger JavaScript code in response to `user actions` like clicking, loading a page, or moving the mouse over an element. Key takeaways included using onclick for user clicks, onload for page loading, oninput for updating as the user types, and onchange for validating input fields. These event handlers allow for dynamic, interactive elements on a web page, enhancing user experience by responding to actions in real-time.||
| Day 36| 2024-10-30|Today, I practiced locating HTML elements using JavaScript to enable dynamic interaction with web pages. I explored several methods, including accessing elements by ID (getElementById), tag name (getElementsByTagName), class name (getElementsByClassName), CSS selectors (querySelectorAll), and HTML object collections like forms. Each method offers a unique way to target and manipulate specific HTML elements, building the foundation for creating interactive, responsive websites.|https://www.w3schools.com /js/js_htmldom_elements.asp|
| Day 35| 2024-10-29|Today, I learned how to make a restaurant website with important sections like a Hero section, About Us, Menu, and Contact & Reservation form. I used HTML for building the layout, CSS for design, and JavaScript for adding interactive features. I also explored options to let customers book tables, order takeaway, and pay online.|https://www.w3schools.com /howto/howto_website_restaurant.asp|
| Day 34| 2024-10-28|Today, I practiced using `AJAX` to handle server responses with `XMLHttpRequest`. I explored two main properties: `responseText`, which receives the server's response as a simple text string, and `responseXML`, which parses XML data directly into a DOM object. Additionally, I learned about the `getAllResponseHeaders()` method, which retrieves all server response headers, and `getResponseHeader()`, which can fetch specific header details.|https://www.w3schools.com /js/js_ajax_http_response.asp|
| Day 33| 2024-10-27|Today, I explored `AJAX` basics using the `XMLHttpRequest` object, which helps web pages interact with servers without needing a full page reload. I learned how to set up both `GET (for getting data)` and `POST (for sending data)` requests, and the differences between synchronous (which pauses JavaScript until done) and asynchronous (non-blocking) requests. Also, I practiced handling data securely and efficiently, such as preventing cached responses by adding a unique ID to each request.|https://www.w3schools.com /js/js_ajax_http_send.asp|
| Day 32| 2024-10-26|Today, I Learned `fetch API` for server requests in JavaScript, covering HTTP methods, Promises with `.then()` chaining, error handling with `.catch()`, and options like headers and JSON payloads for data exchange; now familiar with robust API interactions and handling both client-side and server-side errors.|https://poradnik-js.kodilla.com/ajax-fetch|
| Day 31| 2024-10-25|Today, I enhanced the `Project Pizzeria` application by integrating event handling and data validation within the AmountWidget class. I updated the setValue method to validate and restrict the input values based on predefined settings. Additionally, I created and emitted a custom event (updated) to notify other components when the widget’s value changes. This required adding event listeners to the `Product` class to ensure that the changes triggered the processOrder method. These updates improve the app’s responsiveness and accuracy.||
| Day 30| 2024-10-24|Today, I made significant advancements in `Project-Pizzeria` by refining `the Product and AmountWidget classes`. I added methods to handle widget events, such as changing, increasing, and decreasing values. Additionally, I integrated validation within the setValue method, ensuring that quantities remain within set boundaries (defaultMin and defaultMax). Debugging and testing DOM queries were also part of today's work, which helped me ensure the proper functioning and smooth interaction of the amount widget with the product component.||
| Day 29| 2024-10-23|Today, I explored the two main ways to include JavaScript in HTML: using an external script file and inline scripts within HTML. The recommended approach is linking an external file with the `<script> tag`, which ensures better organization and separation of concerns. Inline scripts, wrapped directly in the `<script> tag within HTML`, should only be used when using an external file isn’t possible. Understanding these methods helps in structuring code efficiently and maintaining clean, manageable projects.||
