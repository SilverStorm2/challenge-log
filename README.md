# üöÄ #100DaysOfCode Challenge

Welcome to my journey of #100DaysOfCode! This is where I'll be documenting my daily progress as I grow and improve my skills as a web developer. Over the next 100 days, I'll focus on learning new technologies, honing my coding abilities, and building projects that showcase my development journey.

## Challenge Goals üéØ
- **Primary Goal:** Master JavaScript and become proficient in front-end web development.
- **Secondary Goals:**
  - Goal 1: Build and deploy a personal website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - Goal 2: Enhance my JavaScript skills by developing various projects.
  - Goal 3: Learn to implement clean code practices and collaborate effectively in coding environments.

## Daily Log üìÖ

| Day  | Date       | Summary of Work Done                                                                                 | Links/Notes |
|------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Day 3| 2024-09-27 |                                                                                                      |             |
| Day 3| 2024-09-27 | Today, I focused on optimizing and expanding the generateTags function by using JavaScript objects to track tag occurrences. I learned the benefits of using objects over arrays for counting elements, making the code more efficient and structured. Additionally, I implemented a calculateTagsParams function to dynamically compute tag frequencies, which was a great exercise in manipulating and iterating through objects.

I also deepened my understanding of creating and applying CSS classes programmatically, enhancing the visual appearance of the tag cloud based on tag frequency.                                                                                                      |             |
| Day 2| 2024-09-26 | Today, I refactored the `generateTags` function to eliminate duplicate code and improve efficiency. I also fixed event listener bindings for both tags and authors, ensuring proper interaction when filtering articles. The `titleClickHandler` function was enhanced for better link activation and article display management. I successfully tested the dynamic tag and author filtering system. |             |
| Day 1| 2024-09-25 | Today, I set the foundation for my #100DaysOfCode challenge by working on JavaScript basics and setting up my development environment. I configured essential tools like Git for version control and ESLint for code quality. I also began working on a dynamic blog project where tags and authors are generated from data-attributes, ensuring cleaner HTML. Additionally, I learned how to manage dependencies using NPM and practiced integrating Prettier for code formatting. | [Link to code/project] |
