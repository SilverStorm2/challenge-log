- **Secondary Goals:**
  - Goal 1: Build and deploy a personal website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - Goal 2: Enhance my JavaScript skills by developing various projects.
  - Goal 3: Learn to implement clean code practices and collaborate effectively in coding environments.

## Daily Log üìÖ

| Day  | Date       | Summary of Work Done                                                                                 | Links/Notes |
|------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Day 5| 2024-09-29 | Today, I focused on configuring Prettier and ESLint to maintain consistent code styling and improve readability. I explored how specific settings in Prettier, such as using single quotes, enforcing semicolons, and trailing commas, impact code formatting. Additionally, I learned to customize ESLint rules to support modern JavaScript (ES6) while allowing for browser-specific globals. I also experimented with disabling and modifying ESLint rules like no-console and quotes, to adapt them to my coding needs. This process helped me understand how these tools work together to create a streamlined development experience.                                                                                                     |             |
| Day 4| 2024-09-28 | Today I focused on enhancing my skills in both HTML and JavaScript. I worked extensively on refactoring the structure of HTML to improve readability and maintainability, specifically updating the data attributes and reorganizing the hierarchy of elements in the sidebar. In JavaScript, I deepened my understanding of DOM manipulation and event handling by refining functions such as generateTitleLinks, generateTags, and generateAuthors. I also tackled logical errors in event handlers and fixed variable scope issues. This session helped solidify my knowledge of code modularization and debugging.                                                                                                     |             |
| Day 3| 2024-09-27 | Today, I enhanced my JavaScript skills by refactoring the generateTags function and learning how to work efficiently with objects and arrays. I implemented a new calculateTagsParams function to dynamically analyze tag frequency and adjust styles accordingly. Additionally, I improved event listeners for both tags and authors, ensuring a smooth user experience when filtering articles.                                                                                                     |             |
| Day 2| 2024-09-26 | Today, I refactored the `generateTags` function to eliminate duplicate code and improve efficiency. I also fixed event listener bindings for both tags and authors, ensuring proper interaction when filtering articles. The `titleClickHandler` function was enhanced for better link activation and article display management. I successfully tested the dynamic tag and author filtering system. |             |
| Day 1| 2024-09-25 | Today, I set the foundation for my #100DaysOfCode challenge by working on JavaScript basics and setting up my development environment. I configured essential tools like Git for version control and ESLint for code quality. I also began working on a dynamic blog project where tags and authors are generated from data-attributes, ensuring cleaner HTML. Additionally, I learned how to manage dependencies using NPM and practiced integrating Prettier for code formatting. | [Link to code/project] |
